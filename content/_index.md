## Welcome!

Greetings from Yihao! I am currently a 2nd-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am honored to have my PhD co-advised by Prof. Luke Theogarajan from UCSB, and Prof. Bongjin Kim from KAIST (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). 

My research interests include digital and mixed-signal in-memory computing, ASIC-based Ising machines, and hardware accelerators for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, photography, and gaming. One of my dreams is to own a pickup truck (Espicially Ford F-150 Raptor) and travel the world with a capybara by my side.
